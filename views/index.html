                        Communications security (COMSEC) is the prevention 
                        of unauthorized access to telecommunications traffic, 
                        or to any written information that is transmitted or 
                        transferred. There are several COMSEC disciplines, 
                        including, but not limited to Transmission, Cryptography 
                        and Physical Computer Security<br /><a href="https://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/COMSEC-communications-security">source</a> <br />
